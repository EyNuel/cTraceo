{"body":"## Introduction\r\nThe cTraceo Acoustic Raytracing Model is a propagation model for use in underwater acoustics and was developed at the [Signal Processing Laboratory](http://www.siplab.fct.ualg.pt/) of the [University of the Algarve](http://www.ualg.pt/). cTraceo is a Gaussian beam tracing model for 2D waveguides written in C.  \r\nSee the features section below and take a look at our [Getting Started](https://github.com/EyNuel/cTraceo/wiki/Getting-Started) guide before proceeding to the [downloads](https://github.com/EyNuel/cTraceo/downloads) section. You may also want to take a look at the [Troubleshooting page](https://github.com/EyNuel/cTraceo/wiki/Troubleshooting).  \r\n   \r\nShould you have any questions, suggestions or feedback, please don't hesitate in [contacting us](https://github.com/EyNuel/cTraceo/wiki/Contact).\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* Range dependent altimetry/bathymetry including range dependent elastic properties (Compressional and shear wave speeds, density, as well as compressional and shear attenuation);\r\n  \r\n* Range dependent sound speed fields;\r\n \r\n* Support for user-defined smooth objects within waveguide (like rocks, marine mammals, submarines);\r\n   \r\n* Full suppport for backscattering (from altimetry/bathymetry or objects);\r\n   \r\n* Allows free positioning of acoustic source and receivers (altimetry/bathymetry as well as objects and receivers may be positioned behind the source for modelling complex waveguides);\r\n   \r\n* Support for horizontal, vertical, rectangular and arbitrarily shaped receiver arrays (allows modelling unusual array shapes, multiple arrays as well as array distortions);\r\n   \r\n* Output options: ray trajectories and amplitudes, eigenray search (with user-definable proximity threshhold), arrival patterns, acoustic pressure, coherent transmission loss, as well as particle velocity components (for modelling vector sensors).\r\n   \r\n* Outputs are written to .mat files (does not require Matlab(R) for compilation/usage)\r\n\r\n* Cross Platform: runs on both Windows and Linux, and has been tested on an ARM embedded system.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n## Software Requirements\r\nCompiled binaries of cTraceo for Windows and Linux are available in the [downloads](https://github.com/EyNuel/cTraceo/downloads) section. Alternatively you can download the source code and compile it yourself.\r\n\r\n### Compiler Support\r\ncTraceo requires a C Compiler compatible with the ISO C99 Standard. This is mostly due to the need for complex (Imaginary) Math:\r\n  \r\n* The GNU C Compiler  \r\nGCC fully supports the ISO C99 standard as of version 4.5. The 4.3.x and 4.4.x versions partially implement the C99 standard and although warnings related to imaginary math may be generated, the code is compiled successfully.  \r\nSuccessfully tested with versions 4.4.4 and 4.4.5 on Linux as well as with version 4.5.3 on Windows (using Cygwin)\r\n  \r\n* Clang - LLVM C Language Frontend  \r\nThe Clang compiler is the compiler used for development of the cTraceo Model.  \r\nSuccessfully tested with versions 2.8 and 2.9 on Linux.\r\n  \r\n* MS Visual Studio  \r\nNo version of Microsoft's Visual Studio C Compiler supports the ISO C99 Standard, so compilation should not be possible.  \r\nNot tested.\r\n\r\n### Matfile output\r\nThis software generates Matlab .mat-files as output, and provides 2 methods for writing these files:  \r\n\r\n1. Linking with Matlab(R) libraries during compilation.  \r\n2. Using a set of internal functions.  \r\n\r\nOption 2 is now the recommended method and is enabled by default. Although it is still possible to fall back to option 1 this requires some extra configuration, is only supported on Linux and requires a Matlab(R) License to be available.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n## Compilation and Installation\r\n### Linux\r\nJust run:\r\n    \r\n    $> make\r\n   \r\nThis will compile the model and place a binary named \"ctraceo\" in the \"bin/\" subdirectory.\r\n   \r\n### Windows\r\nTo compile cTraceo on windows, several steps are required:  \r\n   \r\n1. Download and install Cygwin from www.cygwin.com.\r\nCygwin provides basic linux build tools (like 'make') for windows.  \r\nWhen installing Cygwin packages, select the following packages:  \r\n\"devel > gcc4\"  \r\n\"devel > make\"  \r\nSeveral other packages will be installed for dependencies.\r\n\r\n2. Add \"c:/cygwin/bin\" to your system's PATH environment variable.  \r\n\r\n3. Open Cygwin. A command line will appear. This command line provides an interface similar to Linux, and allows for easy compilation of the model.  \r\nIn Cygwin, navigate to location which contains cTraceo's source code; this will look similar to:  \r\n    $> cd /cygdrive/c/Users/username/Documents/models/cTraceo\r\n\r\n4. Run:  \r\n    $> make  \r\n\r\nIf all goes well, this will produce an executable called \"ctraceo.exe\" in the \"bin/\" subdirectory which can now be used like any other windows executable.\r\n    \r\n   \r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n## Matlab Configuration & Example Cases\r\nSeveral example cases are contained in the \"examples/\" subdirectory. These examples depend on matlab functions contained in the \"M-Files/\" subdirectory and as such this folder should be added to the matlab path.  \r\n   \r\nWithin the provided example files the model is invoked by calling the command \"ctraceo\", and thus the \"bin/\" folder containing the compiled cTraceo binary should be on the system's PATH.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n## License Notes  \r\nThe cTraceo Raytracing Model is released under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0).  \r\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\nThe cTraceo model was written at the [Signal Processing Laboratory](http://www.siplab.fct.ualg.pt/) of the [University of the Algarve](http://www.ualg.pt/) for project SENSOCEAN by:  \r\nEmanuel Ey (emanuel.ey at gmail.com)  \r\nCopyright (C) 2011 - 2013  \r\n  \r\nThis software is derived from the FORTRAN 77 TRACEO code, written by:  \r\nOrlando Camargo Rodriguez (orodrig at ualg.pt)  \r\nCopyright (C) 2010  \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nNOTE: cTraceo is research code under active development The code may contain bugs and updates are possible in the future.","google":"","tagline":"The cTraceo Underwater Acoustic Raytracing Model","note":"Don't delete this file!
