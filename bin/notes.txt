NOTE:
Compiled binaries of previous cTraceo versions are included on purpose.
This is usefull when it is necessary to EXACTLY reproduce previously modeled results.

Also note that the third version number refers to minor fixes which do
change the model's output. In other words, version 1.0 produces output
which is identical to that of versions 1.0.1 and 1.0.2.

Changes of the third version number  will generally refer to 
changes in the documentation or makefile.
