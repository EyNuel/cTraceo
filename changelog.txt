## Beta 3 ##
## Features/Changes:
 # Added support to easily compile the model for different matlab
   versions.
   
 # Changed output format for Eigenrays to used matlab strutures.
   This way eigenrays are now associated to the hydrophones at 
   which they arrive. The rays launching angle along with the
   hydrophone's coordinates are also part of the new output
   struture.
 
 # Amplitudes and Delays are now also written to matlab strutures
 
 # When calculating Amplitudes and Delays, the maximum number of
   arrivals as well as the source depth are now written to the
   output file.
  
 # Added 48 M-Files with example cases to the "examples/"
   subdirectory.
   
 # Included a Matlab function to write Traceo input files in the
   distribution package.
   "wtraceoinfil.m" can be found in the "M-Files/" subdirectory.
   Also wrote documentation for this function, which is included
   in the form of comments.
 
 # Included a Matlab function to convert depth, temperature and
   salinity to sound velocity in Sea Water through Mackenzie's
   formula.
   "mackenzie.m" can be found in the "M-Files/" subdirectory.
   
 # Included a Matlab function to calculate Munk sound speed
   profiles.
   "munk.m" can be found in the "M-Files/" subdirectory.
 
 # Wrote a Matlab function to simplify the plotting of eigenrays
   as returned by cTraceo.
   "plotEigenRays.m" can be found in the "M-Files/" subdirectory.
   
 # Rewrote the Makefile to simplify compilation.
   Before attempting to compile, makefile now creates a "bin/"
   subdirectory if it doen's exist.
   The Makefile is now the only file which needs to be changed
   in order to compile the model.
   
 # Wrote a readme to help newcommers to get started with cTraceo.
 
 # Wrote this file.


## Bugfixes:
 # Fixed a bug where a ray could be endlessy reflected between
   surface and bottom.
   
 # Made many code changes to suppress (unnecessary) warnings 
   generated by GCC.
  
 # Fixed a bug where the calculatiing Particle Velocity along a
   Linear Array would cause an all-zero output.
   
 # Fixed a bug where a segfault could accur when determining
   Eigenrays by Proximity in combination with returning rays.
 
 # Fixed several memory leaks throughout the code.
 
 # Many more small bugfixes and code improvements.

## Beta 2 ##
 # Ray Coordinates and other information is now written to matlab
   strutures instead of arrays.
   This should make it easier to handle the data in matlab.  

 # Behind the scenes code improvements.

## Beta 1:
   All Features from the original Fortran 77 version of Traceo
   are now implemented.
