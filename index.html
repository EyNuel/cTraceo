        <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The cTraceo Acoustic Raytracing Model is a 2D propagation model based on Gaussian beams for use in underwater acoustics and was developed at the <a href="http://www.siplab.fct.ualg.pt/">Signal Processing Laboratory</a> of the <a href="http://www.ualg.pt/">University of the Algarve</a>.<br>
Should you have any questions, suggestions or feedback, please don't hesitate in <a href="http://eynuel.github.com/cTraceo/#contact">contacting us</a>.
You may also want to visit our <a href="https://github.com/EyNuel/cTraceo/wiki">wiki</a>.  </p>

<hr><h2>Downloads</h2>

<p>Downloads are available <a href="https://github.com/EyNuel/cTraceo/downloads">here</a> for Windows and Linux.<br>
See the features section below and take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/EyNuel/cTraceo/wiki/Getting-Started">Getting Started</a> guide before downloading.   </p>

<hr><h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Range dependent altimetry/bathymetry including range dependent elastic properties (Compressional and shear wave speeds, density, as well as compressional and shear attenuation);</p></li>
<li><p>Range dependent sound speed fields;</p></li>
<li><p>Support for user-defined smooth objects within waveguide (like rocks, marine mammals, submarines);</p></li>
<li><p>Full suppport for backscattering (from altimetry/bathymetry or objects);</p></li>
<li><p>Allows free positioning of acoustic source and receivers (altimetry/bathymetry as well as objects and receivers may be positioned behind the source for modelling complex waveguides);</p></li>
<li><p>Support for horizontal, vertical, rectangular and arbitrarily shaped receiver arrays (allows modelling unusual array shapes, multiple arrays as well as array distortions);</p></li>
<li><p>Output options: ray trajectories and amplitudes, eigenray search (with user-definable proximity threshhold), arrival patterns, acoustic pressure, coherent transmission loss, as well as particle velocity components (for modelling vector sensors).</p></li>
<li><p>Outputs are written to .mat files (does not require Matlab(R) for compilation/usage)</p></li>
<li><p>Cross Platform: runs on both Windows and Linux, and has been tested on an ARM embedded system.</p></li>
</ul><hr><h2>Software Requirements</h2>

<p>Compiled binaries of cTraceo for Windows and Linux are available in the <a href="https://github.com/EyNuel/cTraceo/downloads">downloads</a> section. Alternatively you can download the source code and compile it yourself.</p>

<h3>Compiler Support</h3>

<p>cTraceo requires a C Compiler compatible with the ISO C99 Standard. This is mostly due to the need for complex (Imaginary) Math:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The GNU C Compiler<br>
GCC fully supports the ISO C99 standard as of version 4.5. The 4.3.x and 4.4.x versions partially implement the C99 standard and although warnings related to imaginary math may be generated, the code is compiled successfully.<br>
Successfully tested with versions 4.4.4 and 4.4.5 on Linux as well as with version 4.5.3 on Windows (using Cygwin)</p></li>
<li><p>Clang - LLVM C Language Frontend<br>
The Clang compiler is the compiler used for development of the cTraceo Model.<br>
Successfully tested with versions 2.8 and 2.9 on Linux.</p></li>
<li><p>MS Visual Studio<br>
No version of Microsoft's Visual Studio C Compiler supports the ISO C99 Standard, so compilation should not be possible.<br>
Not tested.</p></li>
</ul><h3>Matfile output</h3>

<p>This software generates Matlab .mat-files as output, and provides 2 methods for writing these files:  </p>

<ol>
<li>Linking with Matlab(R) libraries during compilation.<br>
</li>
<li>Using a set of internal functions.<br>
</li>
</ol><p>Option 2 is now the recommended method and is enabled by default. Although it is still possible to fall back to option 1 this requires some extra configuration, is only supported on Linux and requires a Matlab(R) License to be available.</p>

<hr><h2>Compilation and Installation</h2>

<h3>Linux</h3>

<p>Just run:</p>

<pre><code>$&gt; make
</code></pre>

<p>This will compile the model and place a binary named "ctraceo" in the "bin/" subdirectory.</p>

<h3>Windows</h3>

<p>To compile cTraceo on windows, several steps are required:  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Download and install Cygwin from <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">www.cygwin.com</a>.
Cygwin provides basic linux build tools (like 'make') for windows.<br>
When installing Cygwin packages, select the following packages:<br>
"devel &gt; gcc4"<br>
"devel &gt; make"<br>
Several other packages will be installed for dependencies.</p></li>
<li><p>Add "c:/cygwin/bin" to your system's PATH environment variable.  </p></li>
<li><p>Open Cygwin. A command line will appear. This command line provides an interface similar to Linux, and allows for easy compilation of the model.<br>
In Cygwin, navigate to location which contains cTraceo's source code; this will look similar to:<br>
$&gt; cd /cygdrive/c/Users/username/Documents/models/cTraceo</p></li>
<li><p>Run:<br>
$&gt; make  </p></li>
</ol><p>If all goes well, this will produce an executable called "ctraceo.exe" in the "bin/" subdirectory which can now be used like any other windows executable.</p>

<hr><h2>Matlab Configuration &amp; Example Cases</h2>

<p>Several example cases are contained in the "examples/" subdirectory. These examples depend on matlab functions contained in the "M-Files/" subdirectory and as such this folder should be added to the matlab path.  </p>

<p>Within the provided example files the model is invoked by calling the command "ctraceo", and thus the "bin/" folder containing the compiled cTraceo binary should be on the system's PATH.</p>
