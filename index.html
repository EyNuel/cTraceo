</ul><h2>Features:</h2>

<p># Range dependent altimetry/bathymetry including range dependent
  elastic properties (Compressional and shear wave speeds,
  density, as well as compressional and shear attenuation);</p>

<p># Range dependent sound speed fields;</p>

<p># Support for user-defined smooth objects within waveguide
   (like rocks, marine mammals, submarines);</p>

<p># Full suppport for backscattering (from altimetry/bathymetry
   or objects);</p>

<p># Allows free positioning of acoustic source and receivers
   (altimetry/bathymetry as well as objects and receivers may be
   positioned behind the source for modelling complex waveguides);</p>

<p># Support for horizontal, vertical, rectangular and arbitrarily
   shaped receiver arrays (allows modelling unusual array shapes,
   multiple arrays as well as array distortions);</p>

<p># Output options: ray trajectories and amplitudes, eigenray
   search (with user-definable proximity threshhold), arrival
   patterns, acoustic pressure, coherent transmission loss, as
   well as particle velocity components (for modelling vector
   sensors).</p>

<p># Outputs are written to .mat files (does not require Matlab(R)
   for compilation/usage)</p>

<h2>Software Requirements</h2>

<h1>Matlab (Optional)</h1>

<p>This software generates Matlab .mat-files as output, and
  provides 2 methods for writing these files.
  1 - Linking with Matlab(R) libraries during compilation.
  2 - Using a set of internal functions.
  Option 2 is now the recommended method and is enabled by default.
  Although it is still possible to fall back to option 1 this
  requires some extra configuration, is only supported on Linux
  and requires a Matlab(R) License to be available.</p>

<h1>Compiler Support</h1>

<p>cTraceo requires a C Compiler compatible with the ISO C99
  Standard. This is mostly due to the need for complex
  (Imaginary) Math.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The GNU C Compiler
GCC fully supports the ISO C99 standard as of version 4.5.
The 4.3.x and 4.4.x versions partially implement the C99
standard and although warnings related to imaginary math may
be generated, the code is compiled successfully.
Successfully tested with versions 4.4.4 and 4.4.5 on Linux as
well as with version 4.5.3 on Windows (using Cygwin)</p></li>
<li><p>Clang - LLVM C Language Frontend
The Clang compiler is the compiler used for development of the
cTraceo Model.
Successfully tested with versions 2.8 and 2.9 on Linux.</p></li>
<li><p>MS Visual Studio
No version of Microsoft's Visual Studio C Compiler supports 
the ISO C99 Standard, so compilation should not be possible.
Not tested.</p></li>
</ul><h2>Makefile Configuration</h2>

<p>To compile this model the user may have to adapt the included
   makefile to match the target system.
   Although the options in the Makefile are mostly self-
   -explanatory, a brief overview will be presented here:</p>

<h1>The "CC" variable</h1>

<p>Defines which command to invoke for compilation.</p>

<h1>The "OS" Variable:</h1>

<p>Defines for which operating system to compile.</p>

<h1>The "ARCH" variable</h1>

<p>This is used to define whether to compile for 32 bit or 64 bit
  systems.</p>

<h1>The "USE_MATLAB" variable</h1>

<p>When compiling cTraceo on Linux it is possible to choose between
  using Matlab or the internal functions to write the result files.
  If in doubt, leave at "0". Note that linking with matlab is only
  supported in linux.</p>

<h1>The "MATLAB_DIR" variable</h1>

<p>This variable should contain the base directory of the 
  system's Matlab(R) installation. This is needed when linking with 
  Matlab for writing .mat files, and is only possible on Linux.</p>

<h1>The "MATLAB_VERSION" variable</h1>

<p>As different versions of Matlab require different variable
  types for calling library functions, this option is required 
  for selecting the appropriate types.</p>

<h2>Compilation and Installation</h2>

<p># Linux
   After the options descibed in "Makefile Configuration" have
   been defined, just run:</p>

<p>$&gt; make</p>

<p>This will compile the model and place a binary named "ctraceo"
   in the "bin/" subdirectory.</p>

<p># Windows
   To compile cTraceo on windows, several steps are required:</p>

<pre><code>* Download and install Cygwin from www.cygwin.com.
  Cygwin provides basic linux build tools (like 'make') for windows.
  When installing Cygwin packages, select the following packages:
    "devel &gt; gcc4"
    "devel &gt; make"
  Several other packages will be installed for dependencies.

* Add "c:/cygwin/bin" to your system's PATH environment variable.

* Open Cygwin. A command line will appear.
  This command line provides an interface similar to Linux, and
  allows for easy compilation of the model.
  In Cygwin, navigate to location which contains cTraceo's source
  code; this will look similar to:
    $&gt; cd /cygdrive/c/Users/username/Documents/models/cTraceo

* Run:
    $&gt; make
  If all goes well, this will produce an executable called
  "ctraceo.exe" in the "bin/" subdirectory which can now be
  used like any other windows executable.
</code></pre>

<h2>Matlab Configuration &amp; Example Cases</h2>

<p>Several example cases are contained in the "examples/"
   subdirectory. These examples depend on matlab functions
   contained in the "M-Files/" subdirectory and as such this
   folder should be added to the matlab path.</p>

<p>Within the provided example files the model is invoked by
   calling the command "ctraceo", and thus the "bin/" folder 
   containing the compiled cTraceo binary should be on the
   system's PATH.</p>
